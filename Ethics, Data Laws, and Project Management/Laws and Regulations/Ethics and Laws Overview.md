# Summary
*Creating a legal and regulatory framework for artificial intelligence is difficult because AI is rapidly changing and we must put in place the regulations before we even fully understand what the technology will be capable of. In Europe, regulations surrounding AI began in 2017, and in the US, AI regulation falls under the laws of the specific use case for the AI system.*

# Key Takeaways
1. Montesquieu said that it is judges who shall be the "bouche de la loi"
2. The differences between general AI (GAI) and weak (narrowly tailored) AI are essential when considering a regulatory framework
3. Generally, mathematical processes are not patentable, but algorithms can be patented if they are part of a larger process


# Definitions
- Intelligence: Ability to acquire knowledge/skills or reason abstractly
- Artificial Intelligence: Study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, humans are better / program that mimics the processes of a human brain
- AI Reasoning: Performing sophisticated mental tasks that people can do
	- Play chess or solve math problems
- Knowledge Representation: Information about real-world objects that AI can be used to solve various problems
- Planning and Navigation: Processes which determine how an AI-controlled entity moves about
	- Identifying safe and efficient paths and manipulating physical objects (e.g., doors)
- Natural Language Processing: The processing or creation of spoken or written human language
- Perception: Capability of computer systems to use sensors to detect and perceive data
- Capacity: Whether a party to a dispute is competent to understand court procedures
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Legal Status: The recognition and rights granted to an individual or entity with the capacity to possess legal rights and obligations</mark>
	- Ability to be a party to a court proceeding as a plaintiff or defendant
- Algorithm: A procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem

# Notes
## Ethics
- AI for good
	- This is the often-political description of the goals of AI
	- Very difficult to explicitly define and even harder to achieve
- Cultural differences drive the discussion of ethical AI
	- Example: applications in deciding legal matters as a judge
- Technical neutrality
	- Tech is neither good nor bad. Rather it is about how it is used
	- This is the cornerstone of the Data Protection Act in the UK
## AI Governing Bodies in Europe
- Many committees and strategic decisions
	- Started with the European Parliament's resolution on AI in 2017
	- Economic and Social Committee's Opinion of AI (2017)
	- European Commission's AI Strategy
	- High-Level Expert Groups on AI (2019)
	- Created the Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI
		- Defined AI as "software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal."
	- Council of Europe's contribution to AI and law
	- AI white paper from the European Commission in 2020
## Status of AI Under the Law
- Currently there is no legal person status for AI, so AI cannot be party to a court dispute
	- However, the European Parliament debated making a status of "electronic persons" which only failed after significant pushback
- AI under patent law
	- Originally, algorithms were considered mathematical problems which are "abstract ideas" and so therefore could not be patented (Gottschalk v Benson, 1972)
	- Parker v Flook (1978) and Diamond v Diehr (1981) however said that a larger process which contains an algorithm can still be patented
## History of AI Regulation
- "Regulation could kill the sector or arrive too late to prevent harm"
- Europe stands between "Big Brother" China and "Big Data" America
- Main difference between AI and previous risky tech like nuclear is that AI advancements are being driven largely by the private sector
- Google argued against the 2020
