# Notes
## AI and Content Use
- AI-Generated Content
	- Determining the roles of AI and the human author must be done on a case-by-case basis
		- Definitions of the degree of human involvement are critical
	- "If there is no human creative input, a work is not entitled to copyright protection. As a result, the U.S. Copyright Office will not register a work that was created by an autonomous artificial intelligence tool"
- Training AI
	- Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (2019 - EU) has two mandatory exceptions
		- Research and cultural organizations to conduct research
		- Exception for text and data mining
			- In practice, this means that any operator of AI-based solutions can gather content, even copyrighted content, as long as it is freely accessible on the Internet
			- There exists a withdrawal/opt out
	- Some suggest creating a "neighboring right" to give artists compensation for their work
