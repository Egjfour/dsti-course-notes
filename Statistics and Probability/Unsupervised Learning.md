# Summary
*A 3-4 sentence description of what was learned in italics*

# Key Takeaways
1. K-means is a general, restricted form of the [[Mixture Models and the EM Algorithm|gaussian mixture models]]

# Definitions
- Clustering: Given a set of data of dimension, $D$, assign each group to a single group $X\in X^D \to y \in \{1, \dots, k\}$

# Additional Resources

# Notes
## Unsupervised Overview
- Unsupervised learning covers two main categories: [[Dimensionality Reduction|dimensionality reduction]] and clustering
- Unsupervised methods are the largest open category of problems in data science
- These algorithms are often very sensitive to high dimensionality and variable scales
