# Summary
*A 3-4 sentence description of what was learned in italics*

# Key Takeaways
1. High dimensional data introduces both numeric and [[Constructing Estimators|estimation]] problems

# Definitions
- Empty Space Phenomenon: High-dimensional spaces are mostly empty, so the data live in low-dimensional spaces
- Parsimonious Models: Making assumptions to reduce the number of parameters which must be estimated in a model
	- [[Unsupervised Learning - Clustering|K-means]] as a parsimonious version of [[Unsupervised Learning - Clustering|GMM]]
- Subspace Clustering: Explaining th phenomenon by assuming the data live in a low-dimensional and cluster-specific subspace of the original high-dimensional data
- Scree Test of Cattel: The difference between the eigenvalues of $\Sigma x$ with a chosen value, $\tau$, such that $d_k$ is the difference greater than $\tau$
